The Crackin' Good Adventures of Otter 'n Duck!
==============================================

The FaiD game! A 2D side-scroller game featuring Otter _and_ Duck, fighting these damn trolls!
But to make the game happen, help is needed! Specifically:

* C coders
* Some art
* Music!
* Play testers!
* An excuse plot

Contact NieXS in the fora, or on IRC (#otternduck) at Foonetic.

Building/Running
================

Otter 'n Duck uses waf, which means you need to have python installed. Compiling with it is
pretty simple:

* Verify that you have SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx and SDL_ttf installed
* Run, from the command-line, ./waf configure
* Run ./waf
* Run by calling build/default/src/otternduck
